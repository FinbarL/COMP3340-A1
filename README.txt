COMP3340 A1

Tasks:
1. Using the US Presidency Dataset:
a) Write a computer program that computes the
    - Hamming Distance matrix between all pairs of elections and
    - the matrix generated by the Jaccard measure.

b) Write a computer program that computes the
    - the matrix generated by comparing columns (i.e. attributes) of the US Presidency Dataset.

c) Now, Calculate the Minimum Spanning Tree
    - having as input that distance matrix.
    - Visualize the result using the yEd software.

2. Now, Calculate the e Relative Neighborhood Graph
    - having as input that distance matrix.
    - Visualize the result using the yEd software.

3.  Now, Calculate the Minimum Spanning Tree
    - having as input a distance matrix generated by the Jaccard measure.
    - Visualize the result using the yEd software.

4. Now, Calculate the Relative Neighbourhood Graph
    - having as input a distance matrix generated by the Jaccard measure).
    - Visualize the result using the yEd software.

5.
    - Using the Hamming Distance matrix
    - Between all pairs of elections of the US Presidency Dataset,
    - Calculate the k-NN graph with k=2.
    - Visualize the result using the yEd software.

6.
    - Using the Jaccard measure
    - generate a distance matrix between all pairs of elections of US Presidency Dataset
    - calculate the k-NN graph with k=2.
    - Visualize the result using the yEd software.

7.
    - Based on the results of Exercise 5 and Exercise 1
    - identify the edges of the MST that are also part of the k-NN graph.
    Visualize the resulting graph using the yEd software.
    - Write down the elections in tabular form grouped by the different clusters observed.

8.
    - Based on the results of Exercise 6 and Exercise 3
    - identify the edges of the MST that are also part of the k-NN graph.
    - Visualize the resulting graph using the yEd software.
    - Write down the elections in tabular form grouped by the different clusters observed.
